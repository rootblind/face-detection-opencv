# Haarcascade and DNN Caffe Model

Doing face detection using Haarcascade and Caffe. The main distinction between these approaches is that while Haarcascade is lighter, does not provide a way to set a threshold or to display detection confidence while Caffe does but it's slower.

Haarcascade is optimal for simple face detection while Caffe is good when confidence level is needed and when more variations play a role in the image detection.
